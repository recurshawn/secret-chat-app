# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
- **Theme:** Retro Terminal. The application should look like a high-contrast, old-school command-line interface.
- **Color Palette:** "Classic Matrix" — deep black backgrounds with neon green (#00FF00) text and accents.
- **Typography:** Primary use of clean Monospace fonts (e.g., `JetBrains Mono`, `Courier New`, or system-default monospace) to reinforce the terminal aesthetic.
- **UI Elements:** Use minimalist borders, "Classified" watermarks, and "Top Secret" folder motifs to enhance the theme.

## Interaction Design
- **Tone:** Classic Terminal. Interface text should use technical, command-line-style prompts and system messages (e.g., `> Enter Room Code:`, `[SYSTEM] User joined`).
- **Media Handling:** Render images and URLs normally within the chat flow to ensure maximum utility and clarity.
- **Feedback & Alerts:** Use a subtle "glitch" effect or visual distortion on text to indicate errors or system alerts, mimicking a malfunctioning "secure" terminal.

## Brand Messaging
- **Simple & Direct:** Despite the playful "spy" theme, keep all user-facing copy simple and direct. The theme should provide atmosphere but never interfere with the speed and utility of the communication.
